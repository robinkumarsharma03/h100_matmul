          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 3 full waves and a partial wave of 233 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 25.0% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for     
          more details on launch configurations.

    OPT   Tensor is the highest-utilized pipeline (96.3%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its  
          different instructions. It is the logical aggregation of individual tensor pipelines. It's dominated by its

    OPT   Tensor is the highest-utilized pipeline (95.9%) based on active cycles, taking into account the rates of its  
          different instructions. It is the logical aggregation of individual tensor pipelines. It's dominated by its   
          Tensor (FP) sub-pipeline. The pipeline is over-utilized and likely a performance bottleneck. Based on the     
          number of executed instructions, the highest utilized pipeline (16.9%) is Uniform. Comparing the two, the     
          overall pipeline utilization appears to be caused by high-latency instructions. See the Kernel Profiling
